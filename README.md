# Colighter

A collaborative web content highlighter, distributed over Nostr

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Build the project with `npm run build:dev` or `npm run build`
1. Start the Highlighter experience with `npm start` - this renders the Highlighter experience with a collab relay using a `COLLAB_RELAY_URL` configured in .env

> Note: If `COLLAB_RELAY_URL` is configured to `http://localhost:7070`,
> you should `run npm start:server` in a second shell
